I would like to thank my committee chair, Dr. Deryle Lonsdale, for putting up with me and helping me acquire the resources I needed to finish this research project, and for his guidance in polishing up this paper. I would also like to thank Dr. Michael Bush, my committee member and employer, for his encouragement and willingness to provide assistance even though finishing means I won't be a student employee anymore. It's his good luck that he's managing to retire just as I'm finally graduating. I am grateful also to Dr. Alan Melby for his mentorship on undergraduate projects which led up to this thesis, and to Dr. Cynthia Hallen for her good attitude, encouragement, and editing skills.

Of course, I also must thank my wonderful wife Erin, who promised to love me whether I finished or not, and supported me throughout.
